### The Conversation

I recently had a conversation with a good friend of mine where we talked about hiring, talent, and how you build a successful SAS company.
One thing that Dan mentioned that I had never thought of was a way of explaining technical capacity to non technical coworkers.
He suggested that he has successfully used an analogy in the past.
The basic analogy is that an organization can think of engineering capacity as the ability to react to change.
The more engineering capacity that you have the quicker and more successfully you can respond to change in the broader world with your software.
Generally when you have a traditional engineer this does not make much sense and I believe that people take this model to software.
In traditional product design you build a prototype, then you test and verify that it works.
Finally you build the infrastructure to build the product and then you produce as much as is necessary.
You may or may not make changes once the initial infrastructure is built.
In this model you do not need engineers full time beyond the initial development and subsequent changes to the design.


### Some thoughts

My immediate thought on this was that there is some truth to this.
Generally if you can sell what you currently have then you do not need more software engineers.
The rate at which the things change are dictated in this case mostly from changes in the underlying technology.
This would include upgrades to software for security or end of life updates.
It would also include updating software for new pieces of hardware that come out.
However if you find yourself constantly having to promise new features then or play catch up with competitors then must manager multiple sources of change.
This would include changes in the infrastructure you need in order to accommodate new features or numbers of users, changes to the code or dependencies for new features, and the changes mentioned above.
