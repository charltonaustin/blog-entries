### The Conversation

I recently had a conversation with a good friend of mine where we talked about hiring, talent, and how you build a successful SAS company.
One thing that my friend mentioned that I had never thought of was a way of explaining technical capacity to non technical coworkers.
He suggested that he has successfully used an analogy in the past.
The basic analogy is that an organization can think of engineering capacity as the ability to react to change.
The more engineering capacity that you have the quicker and more successfully you can respond to change in the broader world with your software.
Generally when you have a traditional (non software) engineer this does not make much sense.
In traditional product design you build a prototype, then you test and verify that it works.
Finally you build the infrastructure to build the product and then you produce as much as is necessary.
You may or may not make changes once the initial infrastructure is built.
Think of an assembly line and cars.
Once the factory is built for that year you produce that years model and depending on sales don't necessarily make changes.
In this model you do not need engineers full time beyond the initial development and subsequent changes to the design.


### Some thoughts

My immediate thoughts on this was that there is some truth to both the analogy and the fact that people bring an unsuitable model to software development.
They generally bring the model that if you can sell what you currently have then you do not need more software engineers.
The problem with this is software must always change.
The rate at which the things change are dictated in this case mostly from changes in the underlying technology.
This would include upgrades to software for security or end of life updates.
It would also include updating software for new pieces of hardware that come out.
The old model precisely breaks down with software in that modifications to the car can't happen after the assembly line (except by a mechanic).
Or that the modifications that could happen must be built into the original design think of wheels needing to be changed for different road conditions.
There is an entirely different situation.
For example if you find yourself constantly having to promise new features or play catch up with competitors then you must manager multiple sources of change.
This would include changes in the infrastructure you need in order to accommodate new features or numbers of users, changes to the code or dependencies for new features, as well as the changes mentioned above.
In the first case you could get away with less engineers whereas in the second case you would definitely need more (or better) engineers to increase your capacity for change.
