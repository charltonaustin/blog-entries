## Election 2018
[The Tuesday Company](https://www.tuesdaycompany.com/) had the honor to work on many races over the [midterm elections](https://www.tuesdaycompany.com/midterms/).
The team worked incredibly hard to and managed to help in some 118 different races.
We had a chance to scale our technology on a national level and managed to have no production issues despite having an orders of magnitude more traffic.
We also learned some important lessons about what it means for a team to grow both in the number of developers and in the number of users.
