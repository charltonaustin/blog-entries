Recently I've started looking at LightTable again. Originally the thing that had interested me it was how easy it was to integrate with clojure, python, and JavaScript.
The editor can be a dream in some sense.
You can open up a new file write some clojure hit ctrl-enter and the next thing you know it will elvalute the file for you.
Emacs in comparision takes some getting used to.
Once you have it open and figure out the key commands to save something you have to navigate the various repos for plugins and which plugins work best.
Then you have to cobble them together.
There is no doubt that once you get there Emacs can be very enjoyable for writing clojure, but getting there can be quick a journey.
Things like Clojure for the True and Brave definitely help.
I think that is where I got my first setup for Clojure with Emacs, but still there is definitely a large learning curve.
Just like the old [XKCD]()  comic showed.
Cursive is nice if you have been programming Java with IntellliJ for some time, but it isn't cheap for a personal liscense.
Still there are somethings that I would like to change about LightTable.
First debugging can be a bit tricky.
Clojure is debuggable.
I think.
Or at least I heard.
Or wait did I do it once with Cider.
I'm sure I've done it once with Cider.
But seriously it takes some real work to get it working.
LightTable is no different.
I eventually found a command that helped me debug, but it just isn't the same as a true debugger.
I ended up using alt-w to watch the expression I was interested in and used ctrl-enter to evaluate a couple of expressions.
What you really want though is something to go over different inputs and see step through the expressions one at a time.
This isn't as big a problem with JavaScript or Python because you have the debugger statement and dbg.
