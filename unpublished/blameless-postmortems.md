Why should we have a blameless postmortems?

I recently read [a blog post](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) about blameless postmortems from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/).
In it there was a simple questions about why software engineers shouldn't be punished:
>Why shouldn’t they be punished or reprimanded?
>Because an engineer who thinks they’re going to be reprimanded are disincentivized to give the details necessary to get an understanding of the mechanism, pathology, and operation of the failure.
>This lack of understanding of how the accident occurred all but guarantees that it will repeat.
>If not with the original engineer, another one in the future.

I'm a big person on why we do things and in our team we often have blameless postmortems.
Recently I was talking with a friend about why and this quote came up.
