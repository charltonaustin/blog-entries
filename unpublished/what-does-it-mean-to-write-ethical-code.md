Recently I read a report from the 2018 stack overflow survey, [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2018-promotion).
Given the recent [investigation](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/26/technology/facebook-ftc-investigation/index.html) into Facebook I thought it might be prudent to do a little thinking and writing about what it means to write code ethically.

## What does it mean to write code ethically
I'm no philosopher, but like most things in life I believe there is some pretty good common sense ways of thinking that will get you through the day to day.
In my mind writing code ethically means allowing people to make informed decisions about their devices, data, and privacy.
This requires that the software that we write is upfront about and consistent with how it uses our data.
That we write software that follows our privacy policies.
That we write fair privacy policies that don't simply protect the companies that write software.
Recently there has been a lot of talk about [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) and how they may have acquired their [data](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html).
Clearly if people were mislead about why their data was collected regardless of whether or not it complied with privacy policies there was something unethical happening.
If the software engineers didn't know what was going on then maybe the code was ethically written (I would imagine that a software engineer somewhere saw that people were being mislead).
I also understand that not everyone has the ability to say no safely all the time, but there has to be lines that we draw in what we will and won't do.
The worst part is if the data had been collected honestly with the true intentions of the use of the data explained I believe that nothing unethical would have been happening.
I spend a lot of time thinking about what political digital organizing looks like.
I believe that the data our users entrust to us should be cared for and that there is a legitimate need for it to be used by campaigns to help bring people to the polls.

## Conclusion
This is a tricky and difficult subject.
Something that professionals everywhere should spend at least a little time thinking about.
Software engineers have a responsibility to society to be thoughtful about the code they write and what it might do.
