### The problem
You want to encourage your team to be the best they can be and you don't want to micromanage them.

## Some thoughts
I'm a big reader.
So the first thing I did when I came across this problem was start a search on Amazon.
Admittedly I only read a few books.
I'm no guru.
I don't even think I'm that experienced.
But I do think I've found a few strategies that have worked so far.
I've also found some dead ends and this blog post is as much for myself as for anyone else.

## Don't get upset
This first one is hard for me.
My initial reaction when things aren't going as planned is to get exasperated when I think that someone is being stupid.
Which is silly because honestly I'm stupid all the time and I know when people treat me like that it doesn't work.
If anything it is counterproductive.
Intellectually this seems rather straightforward and obvious to me, but practically speaking it is always a bit of a challenge.
Interestingly I've never heard it explicitly written in any management book, but it is definitely implicitly written all over the walls of most management books I've read.
I've found that stopping, taking a breath, trying to imagine why the person is doing what they are doing, asking them why they are doing what they are doing and then proceeding helps to humanize them to me.
It also helps me from making silly factual mistakes about the situation.

## Do give praise
Genuine praise.
Lots of genuine praise.
Which might mean thinking hard about the situation making sure to recognize things that are even slightly right.
In my short career I think I've gotten a fair amount of praise.
Or at least I feel like I've gotten a fair amount of praise and not enough feedback.
Unfortunately I haven't gotten genuine praise.
Which isn't to say that the person didn't genuinely mean it (though I think a large portion of the time that is also true) rather that it wasn't specific or useful.

## Give actionable, specific, and timely feedbac
