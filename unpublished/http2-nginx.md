I recently had an interview where I talked about HTTP/2, and since I really had not done much reading or thinking about it I did some research.
The material I found was so good I thought I would write a short blog post pointing to some of the material.
First if you have not read the HTTP/2 [FAQ](https://http2.github.io/faq/) you should give it a quick read.
It does a great job of explaining some of the differences and why they exist.
Next if you have not found [DigitalOcean's](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials) tutorials then you are missing out.
DigitalOcean delivers high quality well written how-tos on many many different Devops tasks across a diverse set of platforms.
The document they have for setting up HTTP/2 on NGINX doesn't disappoint.
